# WinMux

This is a fork of [ZimengXiong/winmux](https://github.com/ZimengXiong/winmux), used for experimenting with workspace preview switching.

## Highlights
### Projects
Projects are collection of workspaces. Think of it like a parent/child hiearchy, you can switch between projects. Each project has it's own set of workspaces.

### Sidebar
The sidebar is a more interactively-performant and useful alternative to [Sketchybar](https://github.com/felixkratz/sketchybar) and traditional workspace menu bar dropdowns for most everyday tasks. It provides better visibility into spaces and spatial awareness on the desktop.

You can drag windows in and out of the sidebar from and to the current workspace. You can rearrange windows across all spaces using the sidebar, including tab groups.

The sidebar can be configured (as shown) to display the current date and time.


### Tab Groups
![](resources/screenshots/tab-groups.png)
Tab groups allow you to have many windows occupy the same footprint, similar to Yabai stacks but with browser-like tab behavior. This is useful when you want to have multiple pieces of reference information next to an editor, multiple tabs in different browser profiles, or, when you simply want multiple fullscreen views without the additional friction and overhead of creating a new workspace.

Unlike stack-only layouts, WinMux tab groups behave more intuitively like you would expect tabs to in browsers, and don't need a keyboard shortcut to activate. You can drag tabs from tab groups into another window's [intent zone](#managed-tiling-mode), or in between workspaces. You can also rearrange tab order within a tab group, and navigate through them with relative and absolute keybindings.

### Philosophy

#### Workspaces
You can NOT create workspaces that have no windows in them. Workspaces with no windows are automatically destroyed.

### Multi-Monitors
Monitors share the global project/workspace state. Each monitor can be treated as *independent* from each other. They each just use the sidebar to browse through projects and 'select' a workspace to view. 

Monitors can not be attached to the same workspace at the same time. They can be on the same project at the same time.

#### App Launching
WinMux supports single-modifer keybindings (e.g. triggering an action on press of `⌘`)

I highly recommend that you configure the apps you use every day to be launch with Left/Right Option+Command, or similar shortcuts, otherwise it might be hard to launch common things into the current workspace (and instead, take you to the other workspace where the app is currently active). Here is some of the apps that I have keybinded:

```toml
[mode.main.binding-tap]
    left-alt = 'exec-and-forget /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --profile-directory="Default"'
    right-cmd = 'exec-and-forget /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --profile-directory="Profile 1"'

[mode.main.binding]
    # Disable the native "Hide App" shortcut.
    cmd-h = []

    cmd-d = 'exec-and-forget osascript ~/Documents/scripts/launchTerminalWindow.scpt'
    cmd-e = 'exec-and-forget osascript ~/Documents/scripts/launchFinderWindow.scpt'
```

```applescript
# ~/Documents/scripts/launchTerminalWindow.scpt
tell application "cmux"
    if it is running
        tell application "System Events" to tell process "cmux"
            click menu item "New Window" of menu "File" of menu bar 1
        end tell
    else
        activate
    end if
end tell

# ~/Documents/scripts/launchFinderWindow.scpt
tell application "Finder"
    if it is running
        tell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"
            click menu item "New Finder Window" of menu "File" of menu bar 1
        end tell
    else
        activate
    end if
end tell

```

## Installation
Download the latest binary from releases and launch.

As WinMux is not signed, you will need to bypass gatekeeper:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/WinMux.app/
```

## Development
Build and run this fork locally:

```bash
make build VERSION=0.2.1-workspace-preview
./.debug/WinMuxApp --config-path ~/.config/winmux/winmux.toml
```

The workspace preview prototype opens with `Option + Tab`, cycles while Option is held, and switches to the selected workspace when Option is released.

## Migrating
### From AeroSpace
If `~/.config/winmux/winmux.toml` already exists, WinMux uses it as-is.

If you have an AeroSpace config but no WinMux config yet, WinMux creates one for you on first launch. It copies over your AeroSpace shortcuts/key mapping and fills in the rest with WinMux defaults, including the sidebar and window tabs.

You do not need to edit anything to get started. After import, WinMux uses `~/.config/winmux/winmux.toml` and leaves your AeroSpace config alone.

If neither exists, WinMux creates a new WinMux config with the bundled defaults.
